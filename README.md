# Library-Database-Management-System

A Tkinter-based system for managing a library database. Add, update, view, and delete book records. Features include a table view, search, and status management. Uses SQLite for data storage. Ideal for building a library management system with GUI.

This repository contains a library database management system implemented using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite for data storage. The system allows users to add, update, view, and delete book records in the library database. It provides features such as displaying records in a table view, searching for specific books, and managing the status and availability of books. The GUI is built using Tkinter widgets and incorporates various functionalities like adding records, updating information, deleting records, and wiping the entire database. The database is stored in a SQLite file, and the system connects to the database using SQLite's built-in module.

The code can be used as a starting point or reference for building a library management system with a graphical interface using Tkinter and SQLite.

Please note that the description can be customized further based on additional features, functionality, or specific highlights of the project.
